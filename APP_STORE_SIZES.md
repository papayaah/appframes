## How to Use in ScreensStudio

1. Go to the **Layout** tab in the left sidebar
2. Click the **Canvas Size** dropdown
3. Select your target device and orientation
4. The canvas will automatically resize to match App Store requirements
5. Add your screenshots and create your composition
6. Export - the image will be exactly the right size for App Store submission

---

## Important Notes

### Orientation is Built-In
- Each canvas size option includes its orientation
- Portrait options: 1242 × 2688 (width × height)
- Landscape options: 2688 × 1242 (width × height)
- No need to use the "Canvas Orientation" toggle for these

### Canvas Orientation Toggle
- The "Canvas Orientation" toggle is for custom workflows
- For App Store submissions, just select the exact dimension you need
- The dimension already specifies portrait or landscape

### Multiple Sizes
- You can create one mockup, then change canvas size and export again
- This lets you quickly generate all required sizes
- Your composition and screenshots remain the same

## Workflow Example

### Submitting to App Store

1. **Create your mockup:**
   - Select Canvas Size: `1242 × 2688` (iPhone portrait)
   - Add your screenshots

## Tips

1. **Start with the most common size:** iPhone 6.5" portrait (1242×2688)
2. **Use composition scale:** Adjust to fit your device frames within the canvas
3. **Check the canvas boundary:** The visible border shows exactly what will be exported
4. **Batch export:** Create one mockup, then export multiple sizes by changing canvas size
5. **Watch sizes:** Apple Watch screenshots are much smaller - adjust composition scale accordingly
