# ScreensStudio - Usage Guide

## Getting Started

### 1. Adding Screenshots

There are two ways to add screenshots:

#### Method 1: NEW SCREEN Button (Recommended)
1. Click the **"NEW SCREEN"** button at the bottom of the screen
2. Select your image file(s) from the file dialog
3. Your screenshot will appear in the screens panel

#### Method 2: Drag & Drop
1. Drag your image file from your computer
2. Drop it on the **"NEW SCREEN"** button area
3. Your screenshot will be added automatically

> **Note**: Clicking on the canvas itself will NOT trigger file upload. Only the "NEW SCREEN" button opens the file dialog.

### 2. Selecting a Device Frame

1. Click the **"Device"** tab in the left sidebar
2. Browse devices by category:
   - **PHONES** - Mobile devices (iPhone, Pixel, Samsung, etc.)
   - **TABLETS** - iPad, Galaxy Tab
   - **LAPTOPS** - MacBook, Surface
   - **DESKTOPS** - iMac, Pro Display
   - **TVS** - Smart TVs
3. Click on any device to select it
4. The canvas will automatically resize to match the device dimensions

### 3. Understanding the Canvas

The **canvas** is the visible rectangular area in the center of the screen:

- **Canvas Boundary**: The canvas has a visible border with shadow
- **Canvas Size**: Matches the selected device dimensions exactly
- **Export Area**: Everything inside the canvas will be exported
- **Aspect Ratio**: Canvas maintains the correct aspect ratio for the selected device

#### Canvas Size Indicator
Look at the top-right of the header to see:
```
OUTPUT: 393 × 852px
```
This shows the exact dimensions of your export.

### 4. Choosing a Layout

In the **"Layout"** tab, select a composition:

- **Single**: One device frame (perfect for app store screenshots)
- **Dual**: Two devices side by side (compare features)
- **Stack**: Overlapping devices (dynamic look)
- **Triple**: Three devices in a row (showcase multiple screens)
- **Fan**: Three devices in a fan arrangement (eye-catching)

### 5. Adjusting Composition Scale

Use the **COMPOSITION SCALE** slider (50-100%):

- **Lower values (50-70%)**: Smaller devices, more space around them
- **Higher values (85-100%)**: Larger devices, fills more of the canvas
- **Watch the canvas**: You can now see if devices are bleeding over the edges

> **Tip**: Start at 85% for optimal balance

### 6. Positioning Your Screenshot

For each screenshot, you can adjust:

#### Scale
- Controls how zoomed in/out your screenshot appears
- 0% = Very zoomed out
- 100% = Fully zoomed in

#### Pan X & Pan Y
- **Pan X**: Move screenshot left (0%) or right (100%)
- **Pan Y**: Move screenshot up (0%) or down (100%)
- Default: 50% (centered)

#### Reset Button
Click **Reset** to return to default values (Scale: 50%, Pan X: 50%, Pan Y: 50%)

### 7. Adding Captions

1. Toggle the **Caption** switch ON
2. Enter your text in the text field
3. Adjust position using sliders:
   - **VERTICAL (Y)**: Top (0%) to Bottom (100%)
   - **HORIZONTAL (X)**: Left (0%) to Right (100%)

### 8. Customizing Background

Choose from 7 preset colors:
- Gray (default)
- Light Gray
- Blue
- Indigo
- Pink
- Yellow
- Green

Click any color swatch to apply it to the canvas background.

### 9. Orientation

Switch between:
- **Portrait**: Vertical orientation (default for phones)
- **Landscape**: Horizontal orientation (good for tablets/laptops)

> **Note**: Canvas dimensions automatically swap when changing orientation

### 10. Exporting Your Mockup

1. Ensure your composition looks good within the canvas boundaries
2. Click the **Export** button in the top-right
3. Your image will download as a PNG file
4. Export resolution: 2x the canvas dimensions for high quality

## Tips & Tricks

### Perfect Composition
1. Select your target device first
2. Add your screenshots
3. Choose a composition layout
4. Adjust scale to fit within canvas
5. Fine-tune individual screenshot positions
6. Add caption if needed
7. Export!

### Canvas Visibility
- The canvas boundary shows you exactly what will be exported
- If devices appear cut off, reduce the composition scale
- Use the canvas as a guide for perfect framing

### Multiple Screenshots
- Add 2-3 screenshots for dynamic compositions
- Use Dual/Triple/Fan layouts for multiple screens
- Each screenshot can be positioned independently

### Device Selection
- Choose device based on your target platform
- iPhone for iOS App Store
- Android phones for Google Play
- Tablets for tablet-specific screenshots
- Laptops/Desktops for web apps

### Keyboard Workflow
1. Click "NEW SCREEN" button
2. Select file
3. Use Tab key to navigate controls
4. Use arrow keys on sliders
5. Press Enter to confirm

## Common Questions

**Q: Why can't I click on the canvas to add images?**
A: To prevent accidental file dialogs, only the "NEW SCREEN" button triggers file upload. This gives you better control.

**Q: How do I know if my composition fits?**
A: The visible canvas boundary shows the exact export area. If devices extend beyond it, reduce the composition scale.

**Q: Can I change the canvas size after adding screenshots?**
A: Yes! Switch to the Device tab and select a different device. The canvas will resize automatically.

**Q: What happens when I change orientation?**
A: The canvas dimensions swap (width becomes height and vice versa), and the canvas resizes accordingly.

**Q: Why does the canvas size change when I select a different device?**
A: Each device has specific dimensions. The canvas matches these exactly so your export is the correct size.

**Q: Can I add more than 3 screenshots?**
A: Yes, but only the first 3 will be used in compositions. Additional screenshots are available for swapping.

## Troubleshooting

**Canvas looks too small/large**
- This is normal - canvas size matches the selected device
- Use the composition scale slider to adjust device sizes within the canvas

**Devices are cut off**
- Reduce the composition scale slider
- The canvas boundary shows the export area

**Can't see my screenshot**
- Check the Scale slider (might be at 0%)
- Adjust Pan X/Y to center the image
- Click Reset to restore defaults

**Export is wrong size**
- Check the OUTPUT dimensions in the header
- Select the correct device for your needs
- Remember: exports are 2x resolution for quality
