# Product Overview

AppFrames (formerly ScreensStudio) is a web application for creating professional app screenshots and mockups with device frames for App Store and Google Play Store submissions.

## Core Purpose

Generate marketing-ready screenshots by:
- Adding app screenshots to device frames (iPhone, iPad, Android, Watch)
- Arranging them in various compositions (Single, Dual, Stack, Triple, Fan)
- Customizing with captions, backgrounds, and positioning
- Exporting at exact App Store/Play Store required dimensions

## Key Concepts

**Canvas Size vs Device Frame**: These are independent settings:
- Canvas Size = Export dimensions (e.g., 1242×2688 for iPhone 6.5")
- Device Frame = Visual mockup style (e.g., iPhone 14 Pro with notch)

Users can mix and match any canvas size with any device frame.
