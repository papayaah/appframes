# Product Overview

AppFrames (formerly ScreensStudio) is a web application for creating professional app screenshots and mockups with device frames for App Store and Google Play Store submissions.

## Core Purpose

Generate marketing-ready screenshots by:
- Adding app screenshots to device frames (iPhone, iPad, Android, Watch)
- Arranging them in various compositions (Single, Dual, Stack, Triple, Fan)
- Customizing with captions, backgrounds, and positioning
- Exporting at exact App Store/Play Store required dimensions

## Key Concepts

**Canvas Size vs Device Frame**: These are independent settings:
- Canvas Size = Export dimensions (e.g., 1242×2688 for iPhone 6.5")
- Device Frame = Visual mockup style (e.g., iPhone 14 Pro with notch)

Users can mix and match any canvas size with any device frame.

## Target Users

App developers and marketers creating screenshots for:
- Apple App Store submissions
- Google Play Store submissions
- Marketing materials and websites
- Product documentation

## User Flow

1. Select canvas size (based on store requirements)
2. Choose device frame (for visual appeal)
3. Add screenshots via drag-drop or media library
4. Select composition layout
5. Customize scale, position, caption, background
6. Export as PNG at 2x resolution
7. Switch to different canvas size to create additional screenshot sets

## Project Organization

Users can create multiple projects (e.g., "My Fitness App", "My Game App"):
- **Free users**: Limited to 1 project
- **Pro users**: Unlimited projects
- Each project is completely independent
- Projects are automatically saved and restored across sessions

## Canvas Size Organization

Within each project, each canvas size maintains its own independent set of screens:
- iPhone 6.5" screens are separate from iPad 12.9" screens
- Switching canvas sizes shows only screens for that size
- Users can maintain multiple screenshot sets for different store requirements
- All screen sets are automatically saved within the project
